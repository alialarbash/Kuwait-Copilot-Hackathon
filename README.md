### Usage Instructions

- Replace [TECHNOLOGY] with your chosen technology stack (e.g., React, Node.js, Express, Django, etc.)
- Replace [PROJECT_IDEA] with your specific project concept (e.g., e-commerce platform, task manager, social network, etc.)
- Use these prompts with your AI coding assistant to generate starter code and implementations
- Adapt the generated code to your specific requirements and coding standards

> Note: These prompts are designed to help you quickly bootstrap greenfield projects. Always review and customize the generated code to match your project's specific needs and best practices.
